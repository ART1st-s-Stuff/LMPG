Bug localization is a common but time consuming task in software engineering.
Large Language Model have demonstrated remarkable performance in
various software engineering tasks, such as identifying buggy code snippets.
Thus, it is natural to consider using LLMs for bug localization. Since the codebase
can be extremely large, neither feeding the codebase into the LLM nor letting the LLM to
check the source file one by one would be impossible.
In this paper, we propose Palantir, an LLM agent that leverages the information
in the bug report to automatically explore the codebase and find the contributing code snippet.
Palantir consists of several components and runs iteratively.
It first gathers information from source code and logs,
then tries to answer the question. If the question is unable to answer 
in the current iteration, Palantir divides it into smaller subquestions
for the next iteration. It maintains a tree structure to store the
exploration process. It backtracks when a subquestion
is answered, until the root cause of the bug is found or timeout is reached.
Finally, we evaluate Palantir on a set of popular open-source distributed systems, 
including Zookeeper, Kafka and HDFS.
